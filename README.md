# labels

The repo contains specifications related to labels for the `polkadot-sdk` repo.

It uses [ruled_labels](https://github.com/paritytech/ruled_labels) to define the rules, requirements and interactions between labels.
The rules and tests are for all repos the same, only the labels differ for each repo.
