# labels

The repo contains specifications related to labels in the `polkadot`, `cumulus` and `substrate`.
It uses [ruled_labels](https://github.com/paritytech/ruled_labels) to defined the rules about requirements and interactions between labels. The rules and tests are for all repos the same, only the labels differ for each repo.
