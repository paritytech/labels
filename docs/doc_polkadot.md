## Labels
### `A‚ê£` - Action labels: used with GHA and trigger a certain process
- `A0-please_review`: Pull request needs code review.
- `A1-needs_burnin`: Pull request needs to be tested on a live validator node before merge. DevOps is notified via matrix
- `A2-insubstantial`: Pull request requires no code review (e.g., a sub-repository hash update)
- `A3-in_progress`: Pull request is in progress. No review needed at this stage
- `A4-companion`: A PR that needs a companion PR to merge in parallel for one of its downstream dependencies
- `A5-stale`: Pull request did not receive any updates in a long time. No review needed at this stage
- `A6-backport`: Pull request is already reviewed well in another branch

### `B‚ê£` - Release note labels: Determines if a PR should be part of the release notes or not.
- `B0-silent`: Changes should not be mentioned in any release notes
- `B1-note_worthy`: Changes should be noted in the release notes

### `C‚ê£` - Criticality: How critical is this change? Which impact does it have on the builders?
- `C1-low`: PR touches the given topic and has a low impact on builders
- `C3-medium`: PR touches the given topic and has a medium impact on builders
- `C5-high`: PR touches the given topic and has a high impact on builders

- `D1-audited üëç`: PR contains changes to critical logic that has been properly reviewed and externally audited
- `D2-notlive üí§`: PR contains changes in a runtime directory that is not deployed to a chain that requires an audit
- `D3-trivial üß∏`: PR contains trivial changes in a runtime directory that do not require an audit
- `D5-nicetohaveaudit ‚ö†Ô∏è`: PR contains trivial changes to logic that should be properly reviewed
