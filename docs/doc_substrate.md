- `A3-in_progress`: Pull request is in progress. No review needed at this stage.
- `A4-companion`: A PR that should be considered alongside another (usually more comprehensive and detailed) PR.
- `A5-stale`: Pull request did not receive any updates in a long time. No review needed at this stage. Close it.

### `B‚ê£` - Release note labels: Determines if a PR should be part of the release notes or not.
- `B0-silent`: Changes should not be mentioned in any release notes
